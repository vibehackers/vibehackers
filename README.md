**Vibehackers** is a community for the "Messy Middle" — builders who use AI tools (Cursor, Claude, Replit) to ship projects fast. We don't care about clean code, we care about shipping.

### What We Do
* **Gallery:** Showcase weekend hacks and experiments.
* **Build in Public:** Connect repos and track progress.
* **Vibe Coding Jobs:** Find work that requires AI-assisted coding skills.
